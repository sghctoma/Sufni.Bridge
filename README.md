Sufni.Bridge
============

Sufni.Bridge\* is a work-in-progress cross-platform (.NET core / Avalonia) application to process
recorded sessions directly from a [Sufni Suspension Telemetry](https://github.com/sghctoma/sst)
DAQ either via the DAQ's server, or its mass storage device (MSC) mode. As of
now, the application has a limited functionality compared to the
[web-based dashboard](https://github.com/sghctoma/sst/wiki/03-Dashboard), but
it does not require an internet connection.
